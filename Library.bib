  pages = {2186-2198},
  abstract = {The present study deals with the efficiency of cross flow water current
	turbine for free stream conditions versus power farm conditions.
	In the first part, a single turbine for free fluid flow conditions
	is considered. The simulations are carried out with a new in house
	code which couples a Navier–Stokes computation of the outer flow
	field with a description of the inner flow field around the turbine.
	The latter is based on experimental results of a Darrieus wind turbine
	in an unbounded domain. This code is applied for the description
	of a hydraulic turbine. In the second part, the interest of piling
	up several turbines on the same axis of rotation to make a tower
	is investigated. Not only is it profitable because only one alternator
	is needed but the simulations demonstrate the advantage of the tower
	configuration for the efficiency. The tower is then inserted into
	a cluster of several lined up towers which makes a barge. Simulations
	show that the average barge efficiency rises as the distance between
	towers is decreased and as the number of towers is increased within
	the row. Thereby, the efficiency of a single isolated turbine is
	greatly increased when set both into a tower and into a cluster of
	several towers corresponding to possible power farm arrangements.},

	by the spacing between wind turbines (along and across the prevailing

	layer and is coupled with an actuator line model to simulate the
	effects of the rotating wind turbine blades. A control case (simulating
	the Lillgrund farm) and sensitivity runs are performed with various
	combinations of increased spacing, with and without staggering. Staggering
	every second row was found to be the simplest method to improve the
	capacity factor from 0.3 to 0.34 and array losses from 36% to 27%.
	The highest capacity factor (0.4) and the lowest array losses (14%)
	were obtained with a staggered layout with spacing across the prevailing
	wind direction that was twice the original. Smart layout choices
	can improve the array performance by 13%–33%.},

  title = {Flow separation on a high Reynolds number, high solidity vertical
	axis wind turbine with straight and canted blades and canted blades

  journal = {Renewable Energy},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {41},
  pages = {13-22},
  abstract = {The aerodynamics of a high solidity vertical axis wind turbine was
	investigated through wind tunnel tests of a full size turbine operating
	at Reynolds numbers of Re  500,000 (where the power production has
	been shown to be Re independent). Flow visualization using light-weight
	tufts attached to the inner surface of a blade was used to gain insight
	on the operating aerodynamics, which is related to the measured power
	performance. The tufts proved to be an effective and simple technique
	to observe the flow characteristics on the large scales involved
	where other flow measurement techniques like particle image velocimetry
	or laser Doppler velocimetry would be challenging and expensive.
	Straight blades on the HeDarrieus turbine operating at peak power
	showed large regions of flow separation on the upwind blade pass
	extending from early in the upwind pass from an azimuthal angle q
	¼ 40e50 (where the blade is moving directly upwind at q ¼ 0) to
	over 60 into the downwind pass. The effect of preset blade pitch
	was also investigated where a 6 leading edge toe-out pitch showed
	a delay in separation initiation and a reduction in the maximum fraction
	of chord with flow reversal as well as increased power performance.
	The overall separation behaviour of the straight blades shows the
	importance of dynamic stall and the interaction of the separated
	vortex with the blade as mechanisms in lift generation. Performance
	and flow separation results are presented for canted blades. The
	flow separation behaviour was considerably different from straight
	blades, with canted blades experiencing less flow reversal on their
	upwind pass, and recovering attached flow before q ¼ 180. The installation
	of fences on the canted blades increased the power and reduced the
	blade speed ratio at which peak power occurred, suggestive of a reduction
	in spanwise flow on the swept blades (so that they locally behave
	more like straight blades). However, the location and amount of flow
	separation did not trend toward that seen with the straight blades,
	but rather the fences further reduced the amount of separation.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an analysis technique for investigating the effects
	of gyroscopic couples on the behaviour of a large vertical axis wind
	turbine mounted on a floating semi-submersible vessel. Equations
	of motion in 6 degrees of freedom are formulated in the frequency
	domain. Time domain aerodynamic loads are derived from a double multiple
	stream tube model based Paraschivoiu [13]. These loads are transposed
	to the frequency domain and integrated with a formulation of the
	gyroscopic moments acting for the wind turbine rotating and the semi-submersible
	rotating in roll and pitch due to ocean waves. The paper uses this
	model to explore the effect of gyroscopic effects on the motions
	of the turbine and semisubmersible. It is shown that the gyroscopic
	effect has negligible effects on some modes of motion but that it
	introduces significant motions at key frequencies related to rotor
	speed.},

  abstract = {It is well known that when wind turbines are deployed in large arrays,
	their efficiency decreases due to complex interactions among themselves
	and with the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). For wind farms whose
	length exceeds the height of the ABL by over an order of magnitude,
	a “fully developed” flow regime can be established. In this asymptotic
	regime, changes in the streamwise direction can be neglected and
	the relevant exchanges occur in the vertical direction. Such a fully
	developed wind-turbine array boundary layer (WTABL) has not been
	studied systematically before. A suite of large eddy simulations
	(LES), in which wind turbines are modeled using the classical “drag
	disk” concept, is performed for various wind-turbine arrangements,
	turbine loading factors, and surface roughness values. The results
	are used to quantify the vertical transport of momentum and kinetic
	energy across the boundary layer. It is shown that the vertical fluxes
	of kinetic energy are of the same order of magnitude as the power
	extracted by the forces modeling the wind turbines. In the fully
	developed WTABL, the kinetic energy extracted by the wind turbines
	is transported into the wind-turbine region by vertical fluxes associated
	with turbulence. The results are also used to develop improved models
	for effective roughness length scales experienced by the ABL. The
	effective roughness scale is often used to model wind-turbine arrays
	in simulations of atmospheric dynamics at larger (regional and global)
	scales. The results from the LES are compared to several existing
	models for effective roughness lengths. Based on the observed trends,
	a modified model is proposed, showing improvement in the predicted
	effective roughness length.},

  abstract = {A wind tunnel experiment has been performed to quantify the Reynolds
	number dependence of turbulence statistics in the wake of a model
	wind turbine. A wind turbine was placed in a boundary layer flow
	developed over a smooth surface under thermally neutral conditions.
	Experiments considered Reynolds numbers on the basis of the turbine
	rotor diameter and the velocity at hub height, ranging from Re D
	1:66 104 to 1:73 105 . Results suggest that main flow statistics
	(mean velocity, turbulence intensity, kinematic shear stress and
	velocity skewness) become independent of Reynolds number starting
	from Re 9:3 104 . In general, stronger Reynolds number dependence
	was observed in the near wake region where the flow is strongly affected
	by the aerodynamics of the wind turbine blades. In contrast, in the
	far wake region, where the boundary layer flow starts to modulate
	the dynamics of the wake, main statistics showed weak Reynolds dependence.
	These results will allow us to extrapolate wind tunnel and computational
	fluid dynamic simulations, which often are conducted at lower Reynolds
	numbers, to full-scale conditions. In particular, these findings
	motivates us to improve exist- ing parameterizations for wind turbine
	wakes (e.g. velocity deficit, wake expansion, turbulence intensity)
	under neutral conditions and the predictive capabilities of atmospheric
	large eddy simulation models.},

	of Darrieus-type vertical axis marine current turbines, with particular
	emphasis on the prediction of hydrodynamic rotor performance, as
	well as their suitability for aiding the optimization process, either
	directly, or as a fast filter of potential blade profiles. In order
	to improve the performance of a marine current turbine it is necessary
	accurately to model the flow passing the turbine’s blades. Several
	types of models exist for Darrieus-type turbines, from momentum-based
	streamtube models to complex computational fluids dynamics (CFD)
	simulations. With continuously varying large angles of attack on
	the blades, the main issue is accurate prediction of the flow field
	around the rotor and thus its loads and torque. This is further complicated
	by the significant inherent unsteady hydrodynamic characteristics
	and potential for dynamic stall. Comparisons of the analytical results
	with experimental data are presented to compare these different models
	and thus illustrate their areas of suitability in this context. In
	conclusion, vertical axis machines have the potential of high power
	capture compared with that of their horizontal counterparts but this
	will depend on blade profile and design configuration, solidity,
	and tip speed ratio. None of the existing theoretical methods really
	captures the actual performance of the machines except for detailed
	CFD simulations, which are inevitably computational time intensive.},

	vertical-axis marine current turbine (straight-bladed Darrieus type)

	theoretical double-multiple-streamtube models, followed by physical
	testing on a scaled-down model turbine and primarily numerical simulations.
	Numerical investigations of a proposed full-scale turbine (power
	coefficient, blade loads and flow behaviour) were undertaken using
	the developed computational models. The turbine design was studied
	using a time-accurate Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) commercial
	solver. A transient-rotor-stator model with a moving mesh technique
	was used to capture the change in flow field at a particular time
	step. A shear stress-transport kÿ! turbulence model was used to model
	turbulent features of the flow. The numerical results show good agreement
	with experimental measurements and the theoretical double-multiple-streamtube
	model. Turbine sensitivity to parametric variations was also demonstrated
	in the full-scale numerical study. This work concludes that the developed
	model can effectively predict hydrodynamic performance and structural
	design blade loads of a vertical-axis marine current turbine.},

	pressure distribution in the vicinity of one blade and the force
	on the blade in arbitrary two dimensional motion. The method is more
	flexible than previous analysis: it can represent any profile, pitching
	motion and blade attachment position. The method is based on conformal
	mapping techniques and Laurent’s series decomposition and is faster
	and more accurate than standard panel methods. A main idea is to
	directly treat the singularities of the flow in a mapped plane where
	any geometrical plane is simplified to a circle. The vorticity is
	assumed to be shed in the form of a continuous vortex sheet near
	the trailing edge.},

  volume = {20},
  pages = {116-133},
  abstract = {Wave loads are one of the main contributors to fatigue loads of tidal
	turbine blades. Because of this, they are a determinant parameter
	for calculation of turbine blade life time. To avoid cost associated
	with oversizing blades or replacing a damaged blade, it is essential
	to evaluate the loads acting on the turbine, and especially wave
	loads on the blades, with the best possible accuracy. Experience
	from wind industry is valuable for horizontal axis tidal turbine
	design and loads acting on the blade can be estimated using the same
	methods, even if the loads are different. This article presents the
	main features of a code written with Matlab, able to predict thrust
	force and torque on each blade while the turbine is operating in
	a regular wave field. The quasi-static Blade Element Momentum theory
	is combined here with an added mass force modeling. The linear wave
	theory is employed to describe the water particle velocity due to
	waves. This velocity is, as a first approximation, simply added to
	a uniform stream velocity to account for wave-current interaction.
	The analytical results are validated by comparing them with experimental
	data obtained by testing a 1.475m-diameter rotor towed in a 260m-long
	wave tank, for different combinations of current speeds and wave
	characteristics. This emphasizes the importance of wave effects and
	dynamics in the design of tidal turbine blades.},

  abstract = {The present work contains theoretical considerations and computational
	results on the nature of using winglets on wind turbines. The theoretical
	results presented show that the power augmentation obtainable with
	winglets is due to a reduction of tip-effects, and is not, as believed
	up to now, caused by the downwind vorticity shift due to downwind
	winglets. The numerical work includes optimization of the power coefficient
	for a given tip speed ratio and geometry of the span using a newly
	developed free wake lifting line code, which takes into account also
	viscous effects and self induced forces. Validation of the new code
	with CFD results for a rotor without winglets showed very good agreement.
	Results from the new code with winglets indicate that downwind winglets
	are superior to upwind ones with respect to optimization of Cp, and
	that the increase in power production is less than what may be obtained
	by a simple extension of the wing in the radial direction. The computations
	also show that shorter downwind winglets (>2%) come close to the
	increase in Cp obtained by a radial extension of the wing. Lastly,
	the results from the code are used to design a rotor with a 2% downwind
	winglet, which is computed using the Navier-Stokes solver EllipSys3D.
	These computations show that further work is needed to validate the
	FWLL code for cases where the rotor is equipped with winglets.},

	distributions during dynamic stall have been measured on a 2D-wing

	on dynamic stall onset different tripping devices have been fixed
	at the leading edge of the model. Adhesive tapes of different thickness
	as well as corundum with various grains have been used as tripping
	material. In addition to the experiments numerical calculations have
	been carried out based on the solution of the unsteady 2D-RANS-equations
	including a turbulence and transition model. In the present investigation
	it is shown that different physical flow phenomena can be identified
	which are triggering the onset procedure of dynamic stall. Three
	different flow-scenarios have been studied in detail: (1) Free transition
	during dynamic stall, (M = 0.2). (2) Fully turbulent flow, (M = 0.2).
	(3) Flow at M = 0.4, compressibility effects. Unsteady measured and
	calculated pressures have been compared for these cases and good

  abstract = {Tidal currents can be used as a predictable source of sustainable
	energy, and have the potential to make a useful contribution to the
	energy needs of the UK and other countries with such a resource.
	One of the technologies which may be used to transform tidal power
	into mechanical power is a vertical axis turbine, the hydrodynamic
	analysis of which this thesis is concerned with. The aim of this
	analysis is to gain a better understanding of the power transformation
	process, from which position there is the possibility of improving
	the conversion efficiency. A second aim is to compare the results
	from different modelling approaches. Two types of mathematical modelling
	are used: a basic blade element momentum model and a more complex
	Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) model. The former model has
	been programmed in Matlab by the present author while the latter
	model uses a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code,
	ANSYS CFX. This RANS model uses the SST k-ω turbulence model. The
	CFD analysis of hydrofoils (equally airfoils), for both fixed and
	oscillating pitch conditions, is a significant proportion of the
	present work. Such analysis is used as part of the verification and
	validation of the CFD model of the turbine. It is also used as input
	to the blade element momentum model, thereby permitting a novel comparison
	between the blade element momentum model and the CFD model of the
	turbine. Both types of turbine model were used to explore the variation
	in turbine efficiency (and other factors) with tip speed ratio and
	with and without an angle of attack limiting variable pitch strategy.
	It is shown that the use of such a variable pitch strategy both increases
	the peak efficiency and broadens the peak. The comparison of the
	results from the two different turbine modelling approaches shows
	that when the present CFD hydrofoil results are used as input to
	the blade element model, and when dynamic effects are small and the
	turbine induction factor is low, there is generally good agreement
	between the two models.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a combined experimental and computational study
	into the aerodynamics and performance of a small scale vertical axis
	wind turbine (VAWT). Wind tunnel tests were carried out to ascertain
	overall performance of the turbine and two- and three-dimensional
	unsteady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models were generated
	to help understand the aerodynamics of this performance. Wind tunnel
	performance results are presented for cases of different wind velocity,
	tip-speed ratio and solidity as well as rotor blade surface finish.
	It is shown experimentally that the surface roughness on the turbine
	rotor blades has a significant effect on performance. Below a critical
	wind speed (Reynolds number of 30,000) the performance of the turbine
	is degraded by a smooth rotor surface finish but above it, the turbine
	performance is enhanced by a smooth surface finish. Both two bladed
	and three bladed rotors were tested and a significant increase in
	performance coefficient is observed for the higher solidity rotors
	(three bladed rotors) over most of the operating range. Dynamic stalling
	behaviour and the resulting large and rapid changes in force coefficients
	and the rotor torque are shown to be the likely cause of changes
	to rotor pitch angle that occurred during early testing. This small
	change in pitch angle caused significant decreases in performance.
	The performance coefficient predicted by the two dimensional computational
	model is significantly higher than that of the experimental and the
	three-dimensional CFD model. The predictions show that the presence
	of the over tip vortices in the 3D simulations is responsible for
	producing the large difference in efficiency compared to the 2D predictions.
	The dynamic behaviour of the over tip vortex as a rotor blade rotates
	through each revolution is also explored in the paper.},

  abstract = {Despite much optimistic language on commercial websites, little data
	is available on actual performance of hydrokinetic turbines. This
	paper summarises the findings of a series of tests on several Darrieus
	type cross flow hydrokinetic turbines (HKTs). Although this type
	of hydrokinetic turbine (HKT) has some advantages over axial flow
	turbines, fixed pitch Darrieus HKTs also have some drawbacks, including
	inability to self-start under load, low efficiency and shaking. Variable
	pitch has been suggested to increase starting torque and efficiency,
	ducts to increase power output and helical blades to produce smooth
	torque. To assess each of these modifications, tests were conducted
	in Australia and Canada on HKTs with fixed and variable pitch straight
	blades, fixed helical blades, with and without a slatted diffuser,
	by mounting each turbine in front of a barge and motoring through
	still water at speeds ranging from less than 1 m/s up to 5 m/s. The
	diffuser increased the power output by a factor of 3 in one configuration
	but considerably less in others. A reason for this finding is suggested.
	The maximum coefficient of performance Cp of the fixed pitch straight
	blade and helical turbines without a diffuser ranged from about 0.25
	at 1.5 m/s down to less than 0.1 at 5 m/s, while Cp for those with
	a diffuser ranged from about 0.45 down to about 0.3. Fixed blade
	turbines, both straight and helical, exhibited low starting torque,
	while variable pitch turbines started easily. Considerable differences
	in Cp were observed for the same turbine configuration at different
	speeds. The turbine with fixed pitch, straight blades was found to
	shake violently due to cyclical hydrodynamic forces on blades, while
	the helical and variable pitch turbines did not shake excessively.
	These findings suggest that variable pitch cross flow HKTs should
	be further investigated.},

  abstract = {This paper presents some aspects concerning the 2D RANS numerical
	modeling of a Darrieus cross flow marine turbine. Two main features
	of the modeling are studied. The first deals with the influence of
	the near wall grid density on the numerical results. Most of the
	available literature concerning the occurrence of stalling foils
	emphasizes the need for a fine grid mesh at wall fitting yþ around
	the unity or less at the first near wall cell center. Nevertheless,
	in the case of a Darrieus turbine, the influence of this parameter
	has not yet been studied precisely. In particular, the exact yþ specification
	is not known, and its influence either on the global turbine performance
	or on the local flow field, has not been outlined. The present work
	provides insight into the yþ influence in a 2D Darrieus turbine and
	deals with its maximum acceptable value. The second feature concerns
	the ability of a 2D modeling to represent, the actual 3D flow in
	the turbine. The power coefficients CP are compared to those obtained
	in the hydrodynamic LEGI tunnel on a small scale model. The experimental
	power coefficients are presented with their associated precision.
	The comparisons show a medium tip speed ratio range around the nominal
	point for which the instantaneous ratio of the experimental and numerical
	power coefficients is a constant significantly lower than 1 regardless
	of the azimuthal position of the blades. This constant ratio is thought
	to be representative of the tip and arm-blade junctions losses.},

  abstract = {Verification and validation (V&V) are the primary means to assess
	accuracy and reliability in computational simulations. This paper
	presents an extensive review of the literature in V&V in computational
	fluid dynamics (CFD), discusses methods and procedures for assessing
	V&V, and develops a number of extensions to existing ideas. The review
	of the development of V&V terminology and methodology points out
	the contributions from members of the operations research, statistics,
	and CFD communities. Fundamental issues in V&V are addressed, such
	as code verification versus solution verification, model validation
	versus solution validation, the distinction between error and uncertainty,
	conceptual sources of error and uncertainty, and the relationship
	between validation and prediction. The fundamental strategy of verification
	is the identification and quantification of errors in the computational
	model and its solution. In verification activities, the accuracy
	of a computational solution is primarily measured relative to two
	types of highly accurate solutions: analytical solutions and highly
	accurate numerical solutions. Methods for determining the accuracy
	of numerical solutions are presented and the importance of software
	testing during verification activities is emphasized. The fundamental
	strategy of validation is to assess how accurately the computational
	results compare with the experimental data, with quantified error
	and uncertainty estimates for both. This strategy employs a hierarchical
	methodology that segregates and simplifies the physical and coupling
	phenomena involved in the complex engineering system of interest.
	A hypersonic cruise missile is used as an example of how this hierarchical
	structure is formulated. The discussion of validation assessment
	also encompasses a number of other important topics. A set of guidelines
	is proposed for designing and conducting validation experiments,
	supported by an explanation of how validation experiments are different
	from traditional experiments and testing. A description is given
	of a relatively new procedure for estimating experimental uncertainty
	that has proven more effective at estimating random and correlated
	bias errors in wind-tunnel experiments than traditional methods.
	Consistent with the authors’ contention that nondeterministic simulations
	are needed in many validation comparisons, a three-step statistical
	approach is offered for incorporating experimental uncertainties
	into the computational analysis. The discussion of validation assessment
	ends with the topic of validation metrics, where two sample problems
	are used to demonstrate how such metrics should be constructed. In
	the spirit of advancing the state of the art in V&V, the paper concludes
	with recommendations of topics for future research and with suggestions
	for needed changes in the implementation of V&V in production and
	commercial software.},

	wind turbines have been conducted with the rotors in steady, and
	thus somewhat artificial, wind conditions—with the result that turbine
	aerodynamics, under varying wind conditions, are still poorly understood.
	The vorticity transport model has been used to investigate the aerodynamic
	performance and wake dynamics, both in steady and unsteady wind conditions,
	of three different vertical-axis wind turbines: one with a straight-bladed
	configuration, another with a curved-bladed configuration and another
	with a helically twisted configuration. The turbines with non-twisted
	blades are shown to be somewhat less efficient than the turbine with
	helically twisted blades when the rotors are operated at constant
	rotational speed in unsteady wind conditions. In steady wind conditions,
	the power coefficients that are produced by both the straight-bladed
	and curved-bladed turbines vary considerably within one rotor revolution
	because of the continuously varying angle of attack on the blades
	and, thus, the inherent unsteadiness in the blade aerodynamic loading.
	These variations are much larger, and thus far more significant,
	than those that are induced by the unsteadiness in the wind conditions.},

  abstract = {It is well known that a wake will develop downstream of a tidal stream
	turbine owing to extraction of axial momentum across the rotor plane.
	To select a suitable layout for an array of horizontal axis tidal
	stream turbines, it is important to understand the extent and structure
	of the wakes of each turbine. Studies of wind turbines and isolated
	tidal stream turbines have shown that the velocity reduction in the
	wake of a single device is a function of the rotor operating state
	(specifically thrust), and that the rate of recovery of wake velocity
	is dependent on mixing between the wake and the surrounding flow.
	For an unbounded flow, the velocity of the surrounding flow is similar
	to that of the incident flow. However, the velocity of the surrounding
	flow will be increased by the presence of bounding surfaces formed
	by the bed and free surface, and by the wake of adjacent devices.
	This paper presents the results of an experimental study investigating
	the influence of such bounding surfaces on the structure of the wake
	of tidal stream turbines.},

  abstract = {Large-eddy simulation (LES), coupled with a wind-turbine model, is
	used to investigate the characteristics of a wind-turbine wake in
	a neutral turbulent boundary-layer flow. The tuning-free Lagrangian
	scale-dependent dynamic subgrid-scale (SGS) model is used for the
	parametrisation of the SGS stresses. The turbine-induced forces (e.g.,
	thrust, lift and drag) are parametrised using two models: (a) the
	‘standard’ actuator-disk model (ADMNR), which calculates only the
	thrust force and distributes it uniformly over the rotor area; and
	(b) the actuator-disk model with rotation (ADM-R), which uses the
	blade-element theory to calculate the lift and drag forces (that
	produce both thrust and rotation), and distribute them over the rotor
	disk based on the local blade and flow characteristics. Simulation
	results are compared to high-resolution measurements collected with
	hot-wire anemometry in the wake of a miniature wind turbine at the
	St. Anthony Falls Laboratory atmospheric boundarylayer wind tunnel.
	In general, the characteristics of the wakes simulated with the proposed
	LES framework are in good agreement with the measurements in the
	far-wake region. The ADM-R yields improved predictions compared with
	the ADM-NR in the near-wake region, where including turbine-induced
	flow rotation and accounting for the non-uniformity of the turbine-induced
	forces appear to be important. Our results also show that the Lagrangian
	scale-dependent dynamic SGS model is able to account, without any
	tuning, for the effects of local shear and flow anisotropy on the
	distribution of the SGS model coefficient.},
